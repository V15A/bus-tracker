# Bus-tracker

An app where you can see busses and trams of Tampere on map. You can also see bus/tram stops currently and a lot more in the future! This is a free-time project which may or may not get better over time.

**Please note that this is _not_ a finished app and there a quite a few things a miss**

## I want to see this in action!

Sure thing! You can find the latest version running at
https://v15a.github.io/bus-tracker/ <br/><br/>
Please note that using Firefox is recommended as there are some issues with other browser.<br/>
Why?<br/>
I don't want to use all my time testing this on different browsers constantly as testing is only a secondary priority and Firefox is my choice.

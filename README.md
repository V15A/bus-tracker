# Bus-tracker

An app where you can see busses and trams of Tampere on map. You can also see bus/tram stops currently and more in the future if I have time. This is a free-time project which may or may not get better over time.

**Please note that this is _not_ a finished app and there's quite a few things amiss**

## I want to see this in action!

Sure thing! You can find the latest version running at
https://v15a.github.io/bus-tracker/ <br/><br/>
Please note that using Firefox is recommended as there are some issues with other browsers.<br/>
